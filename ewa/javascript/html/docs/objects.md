# Objects

!!! abstract
    **Summary**

    - [x] Objects in JavaScript are dynamic; they can change at any point during code execution
    - [x] While OO-langueage lock-down objects based on class definitions; JS has no such restrictions
    - [x] Sie verstehen wie sie Actions definieren und der Action Bar hinzufügen


!!! warning
    **Please note:** A large part of JavaScript programming is managing objects – this is why understanding how objects work is key to understanding JavaScript as a whole. 


## Defining Objects

Objects are created based on two basic ways:

1. ia an Object Constructor using a constructor function
2. in a object literal notation


### Adding Properties to Objects

JS distinguishes between 

1. properties inherited from the object prototype and 
2. own properties 

Adding a property creates a new _own property_ on that object.
