# Introduction to JavaScript

## Language Concepts

JavaScritp (JS) is an extremely flexible language

Rather than encapsulating your programm code in classes, in JS you can start coding as you go (good software engineering principles should be followed of course).

JS employs no formal concept of classes




## Data Types

### Primitive Types

Primitive types represent simple pieces of data; they are stored direcly in the variable object. 
Primitive types are treated as simple data types.

JS defines 5 primitive types:

All primitive types have literal representations of their values.

!!! note
    __Definition: Literal__  
    Literals represent values that are not stored in a variable, such as a hard-coded name or value 


### Reference Types

!!! note
    __Definition: Reference Type__  
    A reference type is an object that serves as boilerplate for the creation of other objects (so-called: reference values). 
    Objects created from reference types are called _instances_ of that reference type or _reference values_.

 

!!! note
    __Definition: Reference Value__  
    A reference value is an object that has been created (e.g. through a constructor function) from a reference type. 
    A reference value is called an instance of its constructing reference type.


!!! note
    __Definition: Object__  
    Objects are the central elements in JS. 
    Objects are either defined as reference types or reference values.
    Objects consist of an unordered number of properties inherited from their prototype and individually defined properties (so-called own properties).
    Concrete object data are stored as references to memory locations.
