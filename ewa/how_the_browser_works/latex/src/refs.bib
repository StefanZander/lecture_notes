	Abstract = {this paper, we examine the history of the web browser domain and identify several underlying forces that have contributed to its evolution. We develop a reference architecture for web browsers based on two well known open source implementations, and we validate it against five additional implementations. We analyze the maintenance implications of di#erent strategies for code reuse, and we identify several underlying evolutionary phenomena in the web browser domain; namely, emergent domain boundaries, convergent evolution, and tension between open and closed source development approaches},
