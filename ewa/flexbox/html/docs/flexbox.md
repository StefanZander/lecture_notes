# Basic Principles of UI Design

> The moment the user sees your UI, it communicates where they have arrived, what they can do, and how they should do it. The user receives this message from every aspect of your design: graphical and textual, silent and audible, static and moving, intentional and accidental. Figure out what you want that message to be, then do everything you can to ensure the message your UI sends is as close as possible to the one you intended.
> ––JAN MIKSOVSKY

This lecture teaches you basic principles for designing good and intuitive UIs. Those principles apply to many kinds of systems (Web-based system, mobile app, desktop app etc).

## Introduction

### UI versus UX

This section breifly discusses the differences between UI (user interface design) and UX (user experience)

* **User Interface (UI)**: A user interface connects users to a product's underlying technology; it is what users see and feel directly when using a product or system.
* **User Experience (UX)**: User experience encompasses the entire experience users have with a product or software system. That experience includes the UI, but it also transcends the UI to include the internals that users do not interact with directly, as well as the externals, such as a purchasing process, technical support etc. E.g. for a car, the internals include engine, chassis, handling, and reliability; the externals are product showroom, the purchasing and delivery experience, manuals, warranty etc.

User interface design addresses actions users must do, whereas user experience design also addresses actions users do not have to do; it is the more encompassing action/goal.

### Basic Concepts

A user interface is essentially a **conversation between the user and a software system** to perfom tasks to achieve users' goals.
A UI differs from conversation primarily in that it uses the **language of UI elements** instead of natural language.
A well designed UI communicates with its users in a way that is

* natural
* professional
* friendly
* easy to understand
* efficient.

By contrast, poorly designed UIs are unnatural, technological and mechanical, and require users to apply thought, experimentation, memorization, and training to translate it into something meaningful.

!!! note "User Interface Design is not a subjective visual art"
    From this point of view, user interface design is not a subjective visual art about pixels and aestethics but rather a **principled objective communication skill** to explain tasks to users.

    By focusing on communication, **design decisions** that appear subjective (such as control selection, icon design, layout, color scheme etc.) become much more **objective**.

Style, color schemes, fashion are largely subjective, but aspects that constitute a comprehensible and intuitive task explanation to the target users are not.
Therefore, every user interface element can be **evaluated by how effectively it communicates its role and contribution** towards the fulfillment of users' tasks.
If a UI containts elements, that communicate nothing, they should be removed.

!!! abstract "Principle x: UI is essentially Human-like Communication"
    The most important concept is to understand that UI is **not** a completely different form of communication. A good and ituitve UI is designed to **communicate to people**, not robots, so it employs many concepts of human communication.

!!! abstract "Principle x: Friendliness"
    If a UI communicates in a way that would be inappropriate or rude in person, it is equally inappropriate or rude in a system.

For example, consider the classic question
> "should I use radio buttons or a checkbox?"

There are potentially dozens of possible considerations, but answering the question with
> "What are you trying to communicate?"

helps in driving the decision.

If you are providing an option that can be turned on or off, a checkbox is the better choice; if you are providing two or more independent states, radio buttons are the better choice.
