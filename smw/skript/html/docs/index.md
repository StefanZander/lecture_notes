 <!-- Welcome to the course pages of the module "Introduction to Ontology-based Knowledge Management with Semantic MediaWiki". -->

<!-- Stand: 2019-03-18 -->

The following pages contain information about 

* the module's main educational contents, 
* course milestones to achieve in order to successfully pass the course, 
* instructions for successfully completing the practical part.

!!! note
    **Please note:** The lecture materials are written in both English and German language, i.e., for some parts, the language changes from English to German in vice versa. This is due to the fact that the course's contents are continuously extendended and revised and primary content is directly integrated without translation to make it immediately available. 

<!-- They serve as a guideline in preparing the materials needed for successfully passing the course. -->

The information on this site is separated into 

- **course details**, i.e., objectives, schedule, milestones, assessment etc., and
- **content details**, i.e., background information about how to write a proper scientific paper.

## Semester Project

Although the tasks are listed and numbered in a sequential order, most of them should be worked in parallel and in an iterative and incremental manner. 

<!-- Please note that the order of tasks is not necessarily always sequentional. For some tasks (e.g. 4 / 5 / 6) it might by useful to conduct them in parallel and in an incremental and iterative manner.  -->
