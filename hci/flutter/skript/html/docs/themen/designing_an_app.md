# How to build an App

!!! success "Key Points"
    - **Define Purpose and Goals**: Clearly outline what your app will do and its primary goals.
    - Create and initialize a new Flutter project by using the `flutter create` command.
    - Organize your project files and directories for better maintainability (e.g., separate folders for screens, widgets, models, services).
    - Use Flutter’s extensive widget library to build the UI components.
    - Implement layout structures like `Column`, `Row`, `Stack`, and navigation using `Navigator` or named routes.
    - Select a state management approach suitable for your app’s complexity (e.g., Provider, Riverpod, Bloc, Redux).
    - Properly manage state across widgets and screens to ensure responsiveness and performance.
    - Use packages like `http` or `dio` for making network requests.
    - Use local storage solutions like Shared Preferences, SQLite, or Hive for storing persistent data.
    - Write unit tests to verify the logic of individual components.
    - Write widget tests to ensure UI components behave as expected.
    - Use Flutter’s DevTools to profile the app, identify performance bottlenecks, and debug issues.

## General 

### Separate Widgets

Having separate widgets for separate logical parts of your UI is an important way of managing complexity in Flutter. -->
