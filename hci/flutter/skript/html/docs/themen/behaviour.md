## How to read text from a TextField

In order to read the contents of a textfield, i.e., the text the user has entered and use it for creating a new list item, a TextEditingController is needed.

The TextEditingController allows to read text from an TextField and also provides other widgets to control the behaviour of the textfield the controller is assigned to (e.g. to clear the inputs after an action is performed or add spaces to an entered IBAN).
