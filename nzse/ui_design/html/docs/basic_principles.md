# Basic Principles of User Interface Design

> The moment the user sees your UI, it communicates where they have arrived, what they can do, and how they should do it. The user receives this message from every aspect of your design: graphical and textual, silent and audible, static and moving, intentional and accidental. Figure out what you want that message to be, then do everything you can to ensure the message your UI sends is as close as possible to the one you intended.

This lecture teaches you basic principles for designing good and intuitive UIs. Those principles apply to many kinds of systems (Web-based system, mobile app, desktop app etc).

## Introduction

### User Interface versus User Experience

This section briefly discusses the __differences__ between __User Interface Design__ (UI) and __User Experience Design__ (UX).

Both elements are crucial to a product and work closely together. But despite their professional relationship, the roles themselves are quite different, referring to very different parts of the process and the design discipline. Where UX Design is a more analytical and technical field, UI Design is closer to what we refer to as graphic or visual design, though the responsibilities are somewhat more complex.

* **User Interface (UI)**: A user interface connects users to a product's underlying technology; it is what users see and feel directly when using a product or system.
* **User Experience (UX)**: User experience encompasses the entire experience users have with a product or software system. That experience includes the UI, but it also transcends the UI to include the internals that users do not interact with directly, as well as the externals, such as a purchasing process, technical support etc. E.g. for a car, the internals include engine, chassis, handling, and reliability; the externals are product showroom, the purchasing and delivery experience, manuals, warranty etc.

User interface design addresses actions users must do, whereas user experience design also addresses actions users do not have to do; it is the more encompassing action/goal.

!!! note "The Body Analogy (Source: <https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/the-difference-between-ux-and-ui-design-a-laymans-guide/>)"
    If you imagine a product as the human body, 

    * the __bones__ represent the code which give it structure.
    * The __organs__ represent the UX design: measuring and optimizing against input for supporting life functions.
    
    And UI design represents the cosmetics of the body–its presentation, its senses and reactions.

As a consequence, User experience design is a __human-first way__ of designing products.


## What is User Experience?

Source: <https://academic.oup.com/iwc/article/23/5/473/660020>

User experience is a __multidimensional concept__ and a commonly accepted definition is still lacking. As Hassenzahl and Tractinsky (2006) argue, the concept of user experience attempts to go beyond the task-oriented approach of traditional HCI by bringing out aspects such as 

* beauty, 
* fun, 
* pleasure, and 
* personal growth 

that satisfy general human needs but have little instrumental value. 

Therefore, when compared to basic usability, __enjoyability plays an essential role in user experience__. The extent to which an interactive product is enjoyable to use is referred to as the __product’s hedonic quality__ (Hassenzahl et al., 2000; Hassenzahl, 2001). The shift of emphasis from usability to experiential factors has forced researchers to consider what user experience actually is and how to evaluate it (Vermeeren et al., 2010).

A number of __user experience models__ have been proposed during the past decade (Desmet and Hekkert, 2007; Forlizzi and Battarbee, 2004; Hartmann et al., 2008; Hassenzahl, 2004; Hassenzahl and Tractinsky, 2006; Jordan, 2000). Mahlke and Thüring’s (2007) holistic model is one of the most recent and it is building on the previous models and research findings. Mahlke and Thüring (2007) distinguish three __user experience components__ which together determine the __user’s overall appraisal__ of a system and influence their future decisions and behavior: 

1. perception of instrumental qualities, 
2. emotional reactions and 
3. perception of non-instrumental qualities. 

Instrumental qualities are related to the usability and usefulness of a system, while non-instrumental qualities are related to its appeal and attractiveness. Mahlke and Thüring (2007) also found empirical evidence that both of these two aspects of quality influence emotional reactions and the appraisal of interactive systems.



### Basic Concepts

A user interface is essentially a **conversation between the user and a software system** to perfom tasks to achieve users' goals.
A UI differs from conversation primarily in that it uses the **language of UI elements** instead of natural language.
A well designed UI communicates with its users in a way that is

* natural
* professional
* friendly
* easy to understand
* efficient.

By contrast, poorly designed UIs are unnatural, technological and mechanical, and require users to apply thought, experimentation, memorization, and training to translate it into something meaningful.

!!! note "User Interface Design is not a subjective visual art"
    From this point of view, user interface design is not a subjective visual art about pixels and aestethics but rather a **principled objective communication skill** to explain tasks to users.

    By focusing on communication, **design decisions** that appear subjective (such as control selection, icon design, layout, color scheme etc.) become much more **objective**.

Style, color schemes, fashion are largely subjective, but aspects that constitute a comprehensible and intuitive task explanation to the target users are not.
Therefore, every user interface element can be **evaluated by how effectively it communicates its role and contribution** towards the fulfillment of users' tasks.
If a UI containts elements, that communicate nothing, they should be removed.

!!! abstract "Principle x: UI is essentially Human-like Communication"
    The most important concept is to understand that UI is **not** a completely different form of communication. A good and ituitve UI is designed to **communicate to people**, not robots, so it employs many concepts of human communication.

!!! abstract "Principle x: Friendliness"
    If a UI communicates in a way that would be inappropriate or rude in person, it is equally inappropriate or rude in a system.

For example, consider the classic question
> "should I use radio buttons or a checkbox?"

There are potentially dozens of possible considerations, but answering the question with
> "What are you trying to communicate?"

helps in driving the decision.

If you are providing an option that can be turned on or off, a checkbox is the better choice; if you are providing two or more independent states, radio buttons are the better choice.
