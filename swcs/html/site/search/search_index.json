Companies and other organizations, institutions such as hospitals or schools, as well as governments and their agencies all produce and process huge amounts of often personal and/or sensitive data. Of course the growing digitalization of our society is not limited to these organizations. Most people in the world today use a computer in some form or another, be it a laptop or a smartphone. In addition to that, cloud services are vastly popular for accessing data from any- where at any time. Of course all of this opens up a world of potential data theft, extortion and blackmailing, sabotage and espionage. To protect themselves, or- ganizations as well as private individuals, have to employ some sort of protection against these threats, which comes most often in the form of malware. This re- sults in a huge demand for antivirus applications, and this demand has resulted in a similarly large supply of those applications, providing the right tool for almost every environment.</p> <p>Source: SWCS SoSe 2019, Paper #5</p> <p>Example</p> <p>What is the Problem of this Introduction?</p> <pre><code>This paper analyses various aspects of game-based learning to inform developers and teachers alike about the benefits of putting more effort into developing these kinds of tools for future generations of students and to integrate these tools into the classroom. Games play a big part in the lives of most children nowadays meaning there is now more potential than ever to bring game-like elements into learning spaces. Games can introduce difficult to learn concepts in environments where students are already familiar with making them easier to digest and al- lowing further learning to be done on these concepts in the future.\n\nIt is important to first figure out if these tools are beneficial in a learning space or if they would do more harm than good. This paper uncovers what type of games are best suited to different problem sets and different areas of interest within the classroom. Bringing game-like software into the classroom would not come without possible problems. The main concern is that students may be too fixated on game mechanics and the desire to succeed in the game rather than the actual learning being done. While most children today play games and are familiar with them, we must consider those who have never played a game in their life. This is more concerning in the field of adult education, where it is very likely that students may have never played a game before. The philosophy of introducing games into the classroom stems from the idea of gamification. This concept is described as introducing game elements in non-gaming contexts, such as steady progression, levels and a learning curve that introduces concepts over time. The use of games in education offers students a new way of learning. It is well known that there are many types of learning styles out there such as visual, aural and physical[9]. With the addition of gaming into education, students can add another dimension to what learning style suits them best.\n\n\u201dWhat do we mean by the gamification of education? After all, schools already have several game-like elements. Students get points for completing assignments correctly. These points translate to badges, more commonly known as grades. Students are rewarded for desired behaviors and punished for undesirable be- haviors using this common currency as a reward system. If they perform well, students \u201dlevel up\u201d at the end of every academic year.\u201d (Lee \\&amp; Hammer,2011, P. 2)\n</code></pre> <p>Problems:</p> <ul> <li>too verbose; too much blabla</li> <li>non-scientific</li> <li>no refs</li> <li>no ref to SOTA and following problem</li> <li>claims are not verified and validated</li> </ul>"},{"location":"exercises/#scope","title":"Scope","text":"<p>Example</p> <p>Please read and discuss improvements of the following scope section:</p> <p>This paper was conducted to understand what affects games can have on stu- dent\u2019s in their education.

Basic concepts is good , gives me a good overview, im not sure of it being a separate chapter , if the structure is right, maybe ask Zander.Go into more detail in the methodology. Maybe obstacles could be added to the history/stateoftheArt section. Also Economics in the same section possibly. Cryptology is fine,couple more references after certain points. Obviously the remaining sections are unfinished. Overall , i thought the paper was good and has lots of potential. Add more references after points.</p> <p>Example 3:</p> <p>The abstract is good, but you don\u2019t actually say what you\u2019re going to do in the paper, so you should just add in an extra sentence.  The introduction and scope are good I don\u2019t think you need to change anything. You should add page numbers. In the analysis 4.1 I think it would be better if you took out the tool name and \u2013 and the comment accidentally left in. In section 4.3 the first sentence should be \u201cwhile there are many advantages\u201d not \u201cWhile there a many advantages\u201d. Also when you say that many older people aren\u2019t as good with computers it\u2019d be good if you added in some statistics.

You will discover a lot, mostly more detailed in the lecture and through your literature study.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Neutrality and objectivity in thinking and writing     Make no personal judgements and don\u2019t emphasize things you find interesting or fun, i.e., do not over-emphasize things based on personal judgement. Be as neutral as possible in both thinking and writing. Treat all works your considered for your analysis equal, i.e., do not describe one work in a rather long paragraph and another work with onyl one or two sentences. Use identical criteria when you analyze relevant works and ideas upon which your research is based on.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Use literature from scientific databases as your primary source of information     Built your research upon information from the primary literature hosted in established scientific libraries.     Use peer-reviewed papers from conferences or journals as your main literature source. </p> </li> <li> <p>Construct Validity     Ensure the appropriateness of the chosen methodology for tackling an identified problem so that others, when applying your methodology, are likely to gather the same or comparable results (\u2192 Reproducability)</p> </li> <li> <p>External Validity     Consider the replicability and transferability of the applied methodology and obtained results \u000b(\u2192 Generalisation). Your results should be verifable by emperical research results. Others should be able to apply your researched results to comparable problems. Validate the appropriateness of your methodology and generated insights by demonstrating that they also apply to comparable problems and yield similar results.</p> </li> <li> <p>Internal Validity     Make sure that the logical consistency of the applied causality chain is maintained, i.e., that you used the appropriate set of methods for takling a problem and that the conclusions you draw from your observations are both verifyable and valid  (\u2192 \u201cInducability\u201d)</p> </li> <li> <p>Follow the principles of good scientific work practices     This usually involves many aspects even bejond the creation of scientific artefacts (\u2192 consult the links in the literature recommendations for more in-depth information about good scientific work practices). From previous experiences with students\u2019 submissions, the following few principles revealed to be of immediate importance as they directly influence a paper\u2019s assessment:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Correct indication of external ideas and content     It should be clear in your texts what your ideas are and what elements resulted from the consultation of external works.</p> </li> <li> <p>Citing external work correctly     Be advised: Anything you take from external works need to be indicated, i.e., cited.     Only take a max. of 3 words directly from external works, not more. </p> <p>Warning</p> <p>Important: </p> <p>Do not copy whole paragraphs from external works and only provide one citation at the paragraph\u2019s end. This counts as plagiarism and will be treated as such (with all consequences).</p> <p>The LaTeX template provided for this course is already pre-configured and implements a common citation style; so there is no need to modify that.</p> </li> <li> <p>Avoid plagiarism     This is one of the most crucial elements of good scientific work. Disregarding this principle in general leads to desk rejection of your work and impairs your name. h_da treats plagiarism as an attempt of deception and creates a note in your student record.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Deliniate your own work from related works     This aspect is often neglected in students\u2019 papers and even final theses, which is really unfortunate. Science is not about re-inventing the wheel or copying things others did earlier for the sake of matter (e.g. because students think it might lead to a high assessment of their works because it sounds sophisticated and complex). It is about valuing the work of others and showing how your own work builts (or deliniates) from them. This tremendously helps the reading in grasping the novel aspects of your ideas and work.</p> </li> <li> <p>Elaboration of the State-of-the-Art (SOTA)     As we have learned, science is standing on the shoulders of giants. Hence, your work is likely to be influenced by existing works; name and discuss these! The discussion of the SOTA is a direct implementation of the science metaphor. This helps the reader to position your work in a domain and wrt. the problem it aims to solve of provides contributions for.</p> </li> <li> <p>and many more\u2026</p> </li> </ul> <p>Note</p> <p>Recommended Literature: Consult the literature recommendations for more details and background information.

Say what you mean clearly and avoid embellishment with unnecessary words or phrases. Brevity is very important. Use of the active voice alone shortens sentence length considerably.</p> </li> <li> <p>Precise word use is critical:     Scientific terminology carries specific meaning \u2013 learn to use it appropriately and use it consistently. A critical function of technical terminology is to say a lot with a few words, i.e., economy. This applies as well to appropriate acronyms (e.g., PCR) and abbreviations. Direct your paper toward the average reader in your intended audience. If writing for a highly technical journal, you will necessarily use the technical jargon. If writing for a general science audience you would limit the jargon.</p> </li> <li> <p>Abbreviations:     Do not use abbreviations in the text except for units of measure. Always abbreviate these when using them with data (2 mm; 10 min.). Except for temperature units (F,C, K) never abbreviate units of measure when using them in a non-data context (e.g., \u201cwe measured length in millimeters\u201d; \u201ctime was recorded in minutes\u201d; \u201ctemperature was measured in F (or C)\u201d; \u201c100 years have passed since Mendel did\u2026\u201d). A list of common abbreviations and conversions can be found online.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use Past Tense:     Research papers reflect work that has been completed, therefore use the past tense throughout your paper (including the Introduction) when referring to the actual work that you did, including statements about your expectations or hypotheses. Use the past tense, as well, when referring to the work of others that you may cite.</p> </li> <li> <p>First vs. Third Person:     If there is one stylistic area where scientific disciplines and journals vary widely, it is the use of first vs. third person constructions. Some disciplines and their journals (e.g., organismal biology and ecology) have moved away from a very strict adherence to the third person construction, and permit limited use of the first person in published papers. Other disciplines, especially humanities, still prefer the third person constrcution. Limit your use of first person construction (i.e., \u201d I (or we) undertook this study ....): usually it is most acceptable in the Introduction and Discussion sections, and then only to a limited extent. Use first person in the methods sparingly if at all, and avoid its use in the results.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use Active Verbs:     Use active verbs whenever possible; writing that overly uses passive verbs (is, was, has, have, had) is deadly to read and almost always results in more words than necessary to say the same thing.</p> <p>Example</p> <p>Example</p> <p>ACTIVE: \u201cthe mouse consumed oxygen at a higher rate\u2026\u201d PASSIVE: \u201coxygen was consumed by the mouse at a higher rate..\u201d</p> <p>Note</p> <p>The clarity and effectiveness of your writing will improve dramatically as you increase the use of the active voice.</p> </li> <li> <p>References:     References to the research findings of others are an integral component of any research paper. The usual practice is to summarize the finding or other information in your own words and then cite the source. Any ideas or other information that are not your own must be substantiated by a reference that is cited in the text. As a rule, in research papers, direct quotation and footnoting are rarely practiced \u2192 simply restate the author\u2019s ideas or findings in your own words and provide a citation.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"scientific_writing/#things-to-avoid","title":"Things to Avoid","text":"<ul> <li>You do not have to try to impress people by using words most people have never heard of.

Organize the information to present the more general aspects of the topic early in the Introduction, then narrow toward the more specific topical information that provides context, finally arriving at your statement of purpose and rationale. A good way to get on track is to sketch out the Introduction backwards; start with the specific purpose and then decide what is the scientific context in which you are asking the question(s) your study addresses. Once the scientific context is decided, then you\u2019ll have a good sense of what level and type of general information with which the Introduction should begin.</p> <p>Here is the information should flow in your Introduction:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Begin your Introduction by clearly identifying the subject area of interest.     Do this by using key words from your Title in the first few sentences of the Introduction to get it focused directly on topic at the appropriate level. This insures that you get to the primary subject matter quickly without losing focus, or discussing information that is too general. For example, in the mouse behavior paper, the words hormones and behavior would likely appear within the first one or two sentences of the Introduction.</p> </li> <li> <p>Establish the context by providing a brief and balanced review of the pertinent published literature that is available on the subject.     The key is to summarize (for the reader) what we knew about the specific problem before you did your experiments or studies. This is accomplished with a general review of the primary research literature (with citations) but should not include very specific, lengthy explanations that you will probably discuss in greater detail later in the Discussion. The judgment of what is general or specific is difficult at first, but with practice and reading of the scientific literature you will develop e firmer sense of your audience. In the mouse behavior paper, for example, you would begin the Introduction at the level of mating behavior in general, then quickly focus to mouse mating behaviors and then hormonal regulation of behavior. Lead the reader to your statement of purpose/hypothesis by focusing your literature review from the more general context (the big picture e.g., hormonal modulation of behaviors) to the more specific topic of interest to you (e.g., role/effects of reproductive hormones, especially estrogen, in modulating specific sexual behaviors of mice.)</p> </li> <li> <p>What literature should you look for in your review of what we know about the problem?     Focus your efforts on the primary research journals - the journals that publish original research articles. Although you may read some general background references (encyclopedias, textbooks, lab manuals, style manuals, etc.) to get yourself acquainted with the subject area, do not cite these, becasue they contain information that is considered fundamental or \u201ccommon\u201d knowledge wqithin the discipline. Cite, instead, articles that reported specific results relevant to your study. Learn, as soon as possible, how to find the primary literature (research journals) and review articles rather than depending on reference books. The articles listed in the Literature Cited of relevant papers you find are a good starting point to move backwards in a line of inquiry. Most academic libraries support the Citation Index - an index which is useful for tracking a line of inquiry forward in time. Some of the newer search engines will actually send you alerts of new papers that cite particular articles of interest to you. Review articles are particularly useful because they summarize all the research done on a narrow subject area over a brief period of time (a year to a few years in most cases).</p> </li> <li> <p>Be sure to clearly state the purpose and /or hypothesis that you investigated.     When you are first learning to write in this format it is okay, and actually preferable, to use a pat statement like, \u201cThe purpose of this study was to....\u201d or \u201cWe investigated three possible mechanisms to explain the \u2026 (1) blah, blah..(2) etc. It is most usual to place the statement of purpose near the end of the Introduction, often as the topic sentence of the final paragraph. It is not necessary (or even desirable) to use the words \u201chypothesis\u201d or \u201cnull hypothesis\u201d, since these are usually implicit if you clearly state your purpose and expectations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Provide a clear statement of the rationale for your approach to the problem studied.     For example: State briefly how you approached the problem (e.g., you studied oxidative respiration pathways in isolated mitochondria of cauliflower). This will usually follow your statement of purpose in the last paragraph of the Introduction. Why did you choose this kind of experiment or experimental design? What are the scientific merits of this particular model system? What advantages does it confer in answering the particular question(s) you are posing? Do not discuss here the actual techniques or protocols used in your study (this will be done in the Methodology section); your readers will be quite familiar with the usual techniques and approaches used in your field. If you are using a novel (new, revolutionary, never used before) technique or methodology, the merits of the new technique/method versus the previously used methods should be presented in the Introduction.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"elements/introduction_2/","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>The introduction is certainly one of the most read section of any paper, and it largely determines the attitude of the reader/reviewer will have toward the work.

Ideally, you should give an idea of the state-of-the art of the field the paper is about. But keep it short: this part should be less than a page long. Half a page should suffice in case of a normal 15-pages article.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Problem     If there was no problem, there would be no reason for writing a research paper, and definitely no reason for reading it. So, please tell the reviewer why she should proceed reading. A simple sentence like \u201cSo far, no-one has investigated the link\u2026\u201d or \u201cThe above-mentioned solutions do not apply to the case \u2026\u201d, can sometimes be enough to clarify the point you want to get at. Experience shows that for this part a few lines are often sufficient.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Proposed Solution     Now - and only now! - you may outline the contributions of the paper. Here you have to make sure you point out what are the novel aspects of your work. There are probably zillions of articles out there on that very subject: you can\u2019t expect the reviewer to know them all; so make his life easier and clearly highlight what is the difference between your method and the others. You can take your time here, but I suggest to avoid getting into too much detail.</p> </li> </ol> <p>In addition there can be the following optional ingredients:</p> <ul> <li> <p>An anticipation of the conclusions     This is very difficult to do properly. I think that this part should be there only in reports that have a strong position-statement nature. If you decide to include this into the introduction, you might want to (i) keep it as short as possible, (ii) refer as much as possible to the concluding section, and (iii) keep it well separated from the rest of the introduction.</p> </li> <li> <p>Related work     My suggestion is to postpone this part to the end of the paper, unless there are good reasons for doing otherwise. For instance, one good reason for not following this suggestion is the presence in the literature of a very prominent related work, in which case you might want to give immediately an idea of what are the differences between your work and the prominent one. In general, though, I find it much easier to have a related works section at the end of the paper: one reads it when he has already a good idea of the technical contribution. In this case, include in the introduction a line saying \u201cRelated works are discussed in Section \u2026\u201d.</p> </li> <li> <p>The outline (plan of the paper)     It might be useful only for long reports, otherwise I think it is a waste of paper as it does not add anything new or novel to it.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"elements/introduction_2/#further-recommendations","title":"Further Recommendations","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Keep the parts well separated     Introductions in which parts 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 are not clearly separated from each other are usually very annoying, and are certainly much more demanding to the reviewer in terms concentration and energy.
