## Tasks

1. Form **groups** of two people
     
    !!! info "Enter Partner Request in WAI2 Moodle Forum"        
        In case you are looking for an WAI2 partner, please use the **WAI2 Moodle forum** to enter a **request** there. This is the most transparent and preferable way since other students can find you there. 

2. Each group has to choose an **individual Computer Science realted topic or problem** that serves as a basis for the scientific work.  

3. Register at the easychair.org system
    Easychair is THE standard system for organizing scientific events. We, your instructors, have created a conference for our WAI2 course in easychair onto which you can upload, i.e. submit all your work items. Therefore, it is mandatory that all students register at the easychair website.

    !!! important "Link to the WAI2 conference at easychair.org"
        Use this link for the registration and submission of results:  
        <https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=wai2-2025-sose>

    !!! info "Registration Policy"
        Both(!) authors need to register at the EasyChair system. Please use your official student email addresses for the registration as I will use these later to register you as Programme Committee (PC) Member for the reviews. If author and programme committee email addresses do *not* match, problems will occur during the paper assignment and review phase. Be aware, you might lose points in such a case.
    
4. Enter group constellation and working title into the easychair system using the above link.   
    See [Schedule](schedule.md) for deadline of [Milestone #1](milestone1.md)
