!!! abstract
    **Objectives**

    - [x] You are able to apply the principles and methods of proper scientific work practices to other works in form of a review.
    - [x] You are capable of writing a scientific review
    - [x] You know how to submit a review via EasyChair 
    - [x] Grading Factor: 1


The **peer review** is one of the corner stones of the scientific circus. The objective of this milestone therefore is to create a **scientific review** for _one_ of your colleagues' works. With this assignment, we want you to **change perspective** and "look" to other works through the eyes of a reviewer. By doing that, you should not only help your colleagues in improving their works but also find new inspiration to critically asses and improve your own work.


## Tasks

1. Accept the **Programme Committee invitation email** sent by EasyChair
      
2. Log into the EasyChair system and select the `PC Member` **role**

3. Enter your **paper bids** 

    - Please specify one of the four options for _each_ paper listed in the biddings' overview:
        - *I want to review*
        - *I can review*
        - *I donâ€˜t want to review*
        - *Conflict of Interest* (use that e.g. for your own paper)
      
      These options are need by the system in order to compute a **fair assignment solution** for each PC member based on the preferences provided.

4. After the paper bidding phase is complete, the **assignment algorithm** computes an optimal (i.e. fair) solution for each PC member. You will be **notified** by the system via email about the computed result, i.e., **the paper you have been assigned to for review**. 

5. Log into the EasyChair system and **enter your review** via the `Review` option in the main navigation.
