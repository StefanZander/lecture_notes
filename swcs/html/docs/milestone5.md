The **communication** of **scientific results** is another corner stone of the science circus.  
The **form** of communication usually is twofold:

1. In writing by means of a scientific article – this is the objective of Milestone #6
2. Orally in form of a **scientific presentation** – usually conducted during symposia, conferences, workshops etc.

This assignment's objective is to **present your research** to your colleagues (=peers) in form of a scientific presentation. 
Please be aware that a scientific presentation follows a set of **rules and guidelines** that your presentation needs to exhibit.


## Tasks

1. Accept the **Programme Committee invitation email** sent by EasyChair
      
2. Log into the EasyChair system and select the **PC Member role**

        - *I don‘t want to review*
        - *Conflict of Interest* (use that e.g. for your own paper)
      
      These options are need by the system to compute a fair assignment solution for each PC member based on the preferences provided.
