# The Final Presentation (Milestone #5)

<!-- !!! question
    This milstone will be graded with factor: **1** -->

!!! abstract
    **Objectives**

    - [x] You are capable of presenting your research in a scientifically sound way
    - [x] You know what distinguishes a scientific presentation from other forms of presentation
 
    **Grading Factor: 3**


The **communication** of **scientific results** is another corner stone of the science circus. It help others to learn about your work and advances the knowledge in a scientific domain.

The **form** of communication usually is twofold:

1. In writing by means of a scientific article – this is the objective of [Milestone #6](milestone6.md)
2. Orally in form of a **scientific presentation** – usually conducted during symposia, conferences, workshops, technical meetings etc.

This assignment's objective is to **present your research** to your colleagues (=peers) in form of a scientific presentation. 
Please be aware that a scientific presentation follows a set of **rules and guidelines** that your presentation needs to exhibit.


## Tasks

1. Prepare the scientific presentation with a tool of your choice
      
2. Send your presentation before the final presentation deadline to the instructor via Email

3. Attend the final presentations and present your work in class


### Requirements

- Time slot per group:
    - Talk: **12 Min.** – *sharp*!
    - Questions and Feedback: approx. 8-10 Min.

## Assessment

The 

- **thoroughness**, 
- **comprehensability**, 
- **extent**, and 
- **scientific rigour** 
  
  of your presentation will be used as basis for the assessment of this milestone.  

This includes an assessment of the following aspects:

!!! example
    **Assessment aspects**:

    - The work is properly motivated
    - The problem space is clearly defined and separated from unrelated issues or things
    - RQs are clearly and correctly formulated (max. 2-3)
    - RQs are addressed during the entire presentation
    - Methodology is clearly stated, applied to your research, and both appropriate and sound
    - Contributions are valid and obvious
    - SOTA is considered; work is properly demarcated 
    - External ideas / contributions are clearly cited and separated from individual contributions
    - Relation between RQs, Methodology, and results is obvious
    - Impact and relevance of results is presented and discussed 
    - Contents of slides is comprehensible
    - Appropriate number of slides (e.g. for 10 mins talk max. 8-10 slides)
        - In previous years, students occasionally showed up to > 30 slides, which is inappropriate and bad style as a lot of information got lost
    - Contents of slides employ a good usability, i.e., 
        - appropriate extent of information (not too much text), 
        - clear visual hierarchy, 
        - no copy of full sentences or paragraphs; 
        - appropriate length of bulleted lists, etc.
        - appropriate mixture of text and figures or other display means
    - Good and appropriate presentation style
        - no word-by-word reading from slides
        - free speech
        - contact to the audience
        - appropriate use of gestures, voice, language 
    - Scientifically sound and appropriate structure 


## Tipps 

Please make sure to consider the following things:

- Is all external material correctly cited?
- Is the work precisely demarcated?
- Is the SOTA considered?
- Is the work and problem domain well motivated?
- Are all contributions clearly ”visible”?
- Are all results verified and validated (--> see internal, external, and construct validity)?
- Is the reference list complete?
