# The Scientific Paper's Title

### Function

* The title is used to convey the main idea of your paper
* It should provide information about the problem the paper presents a solution for or state the main contribution of the proposed solution or highlight the works aim 

### Style

* Simple and straight
* Avoid overly complex and bulky words
* Use active voice rather than passive
* No complex sentence-like style
* Use terms that are common in a domain; don't invent new terms
* Use a first-letter upper case notation (only stopwords are written in lower case)
* If appropriate: Use a descriptive main title and complement it with a detailed subtitle
* Use a neutral language; avoid sensational words; a science paper's title is the opposite of an advertisment headline
* Avoid abbreviations; use them only if they are really very well known

### Structure

* usually you have one single title
* if appropriate: complement a short main title with a subtitle, separated by ':' or 'â€“'
