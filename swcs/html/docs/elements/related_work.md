## Related Works

### Function

* Science is standing on the shoulders of giants; here you describe the works that influence your work or that your work builts upon
* This section helps readers to see where your work positions itself in the science discourse of a community
* It helps to link your research to related research
* The section's intention is to identify a delta in research i.e., an unsolved problem or a still undiscovered or sparsely researched topic of a domain

### Style

* use a neutral, unbiased language
* only criticise facts not persons or institutions
* critisism should exclusively based on comprehensible and replicable facts, not opinions or on vagueness etc.

### Structure

Usually there are three ways of structuring the related work section

* **The Bad**
    * just present a set of more or less related work in a few paragraphs without a summary of the results, i.e., the insights gathered from analysing them
    * the selection of works seems arbitrary
    * no separation of works is deployed

        > 2.1 Related Work

        >For this paper, a number of scientific papers were consulted. They are:

        >Neal E. Seymour, Anthony G. Gallagher, Sanziana A. Roman, et al. Virtual reality training improves operating room performance: results of a randomized, double-blinded study, Ann Surg, 2002 [3].

        >This paper details an experiment in which a number of participants were trained using virtual reality alongside standard training and then they performed a surgery. Their results were compared to a control group of trainees who only received standard training.

        >Alin Moldoveanu, Florica Moldoveanu, Ionut Negoi, et al. Challenges and Is- sues For Successfully Applying Virtual Reality In Medical Rehabilitation, The 11th International Scientific Conference eLearning and Software for Education Bucharest, April 23-24, 2015 [4].

        >This paper outlines some important issues regarding virtual reality and medical rehabilitation. Some of the issues include cost and issues with the user interface.
        
        >Lan Li, Fei Yu, et al. Application of virtual reality technology in clinical medicine, Am J Transl Res. 2017 [5].

        >This paper discusses VR’s application in numerous surgeries such as in orthope- dics, as well as treatment for pain management in patients.

* **The Ugly**
    * The method for selecting related works is outlined
    * A structure for presenting related works, separating them by topic is presented
    * The section closes with a discussion about the results (or insights) gathered from the literature study (i.e., the analysis of the presented works)

* **The Good**
    * Set the scope for the analysis, i.e., define a set of criteria (or aspects) beforehand that represent cornerstones of your research
    * Use that criteria to select related works
    * Use all tipps from The Ugly plus create an **anaylsis framework**, i.e., define a set of criteria that you use for the analysis of these works
    * Discuss each related work wrt. the extent to which each criteria is implemented by it 
    * Summarize your findings in a table 
    * Discuss your findings
    * Outline the consequences that can be deduced from your analysis 

* **The No-Go**
    * No related works are discussed at all
    * At serious conferences or journals this causes a desk rejection (*ie. a rejection without review*)


### Tipps and Remarks

* usually, you have or should have read most of the related works beforehand, i.e., before you started your research
* reading related works helps you in the identification of an unsovled problem or an sparsely researched area in a domain
* The Good structure is usually used for rather extensive scientific works such as PhD theses etc.; most papers you will read usually employ The Ugly structure – which is, when conducted thoroughly sufficient.
* Collect some papers that won best-paper-awards at highly recognized conferences and look how they present and discuss related works
