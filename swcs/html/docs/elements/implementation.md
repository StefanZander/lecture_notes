# The Implementation Section

### Function

In order to measure the impact of a solution (the approach), an operationalisation or manifestation of the approach is needed.

The implementation section describes the realisation of the approach (or some parts of it), mainly for the purpose of enabling its evaluation.

!!! note 
    **Please note**:  
    The implemantation should *not* "add" something new to the approach or to a concept described in the approach section. Its main purpose is to demonstrate one implementation of it. 


### Style

* Usually, it is not possible to describe the entire implementation to its full extent; therefore only present highlights.
* Do not present every line of code; just present highlights that are worth mentioning and discuss or explain it in the text
* When presenting code, refer to it in the full text; do not present code without discussing it
* Use designators such as in figures (e.g. `Listing 1: xxx`)
* The implementation section should not be much longer than the approach! If the approach section is much shorter than the implementation, then this is a sign that there is something wrong with your approach (either the description is superficial or –worse– the approach is too shallow and embodies only little research)

### Structure

* There is no predefined structure for the implementation section; use a structure that seems appropriate to you
* Use subsections if necessary; concentrate on the main aspects of the approach when creating the implementation structure
* Separate by focus on the approach; provide links to the respective sections in the approach, i.e., make clear what aspects of your approach are described by the implementation
