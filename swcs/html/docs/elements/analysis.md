# The Analysis


### Function

The analysis is the main part of a survey. It applies the criteria defined in the previous chapter to the works determined by the survey's scope. That means, that this section analyses the extent to which each of the defined criteria is implemented in each work that is going to be evaluated. 


### Style

Usually, the analysis contains an extensive **textual part** and a summary of its main results in form of a **table**. 

- **Textual Part**  
    The textual part describes the analysis for each work and criteria. It should be structured by one of the two methods listed in the [Structure](#structure)-Section.

- **Table**  
    The table contains the main findings of the analysis in condensed and clear from. It is displayed in a matrix format, i.e., it lists all considered works in one dimension and all considered criteria in the other dimension. The field defined in the matrix by the current column and row (work and criteria) contains a numeric, symbolic, or abbreviated textual description of the extent to which the criteria is implemented in that work.

<!-- Usually, the analysis is done in writing (e.g., one paragraph describing all criteria for each work) and complemented by a table that summarizes the findings in a condensed form.  -->

### Structure

This section often starts with a description about its structure, since the section can be structured in at least two different ways:

- **Work-wise**  
    It could discuss the criteria per work, i.e., work-wise where e.g., one paragraphs describes the analysis for each work where each aspect (criteria) gets addressed.

- **Criteria-wise**  
    The focus could also be set to the criteria, i.e., each criteria is addressed by e.g. on single paragraph that describes how that critera is implemented in all considered works.
