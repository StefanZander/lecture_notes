!!! note
    **Please note:**  
    LaTeX creates this list automatically for you based on the works you cited in your paper.

    Please inform yourself about the citation style when submitting a paper to a conference etc. Usually, such information is provided by the organisators on the Website.

### Function

* Outlines the research artifacts (mostly papers) that you used in your paper, i.e., that your work is built upon


### Style

* Depends on the community and venue (conference / workshop / journal) you submit your paper to
* Usually, a venue provides a LaTeX template with instructions about the style to use (ACM, IEEE, APA etc.). Follow that recommendation, otherwise your paper could be rejected without being reviewed

### Structure

* Cited works are almost always presented in list form; the indices depends on the prescribed styling format (ACM, IEEE, APA etc.)
