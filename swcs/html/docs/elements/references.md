# References

!!! info "Creating the Bibliography in LaTeX"  
    LaTeX creates this list automatically for you based on the works you cited in your paper.

    Please inform yourself about the citation style when submitting a paper to a conference etc. Usually, such information is provided by the organisators on the Website.


### Function

* Outlines the research artifacts (mostly published academic papers) that you used in your paper, i.e., that your research and work is built upon

    !!! warning "Please consider the following information carefully"        
        In your paper, the references should be **credible** and **verifiable references**!  
        References to blogs, industry-focused white papers or general Web pages cannot be trusted in providing credible viewpoints.


### Style

There are some general rules as to how cite external works and demark from plagiarism, but there is no "citation styling gold standard" that has to be used regardless of the domain, community and type of scientific artefact. 
In CS, however, the most commonly used bibliographic styles are the ACM, IEEE, harvard and APA style.

!!! example
    **Explanation**: *Bibliography == list of references used in a scientific work*

* Depends on the community and venue (conference / workshop / journal) you submit your paper to. In CS, mostly 
* Usually, a venue provides a LaTeX template with instructions about the style to use (ACM, IEEE, APA etc.). Follow that recommendation, otherwise your paper could be rejected without being reviewed

### Structure

* Cited works are almost always presented in list form; the indices depends on the prescribed styling format (ACM, IEEE, APA etc.)
