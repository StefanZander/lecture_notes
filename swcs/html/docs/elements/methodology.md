# The Methodology

### Function

This section clearly and thoroughly explains how you carried out your research.
It describes the approach you designed and carried out in order to gather information (so called *artefacts* in Design Science) that help in answering your research questions (--> see [Introduction](./introduction.md)).

Your methodology should be designed in a way so that it ensures internal, external, and construct validity.


### Style

The style in this section should read as if you were verbally describing the conduct of the research. You may use the active voice to a certain extent, although this section requires more use of third person, passive constructions than others. Remember to use the past tense throughout - the work being reported is done, and was performed in the past, not the future. The Methodology section is not a step-by-step directive as you see in many tutorials over the Web; it is also not a protocol or report that reports about the steps carried out. 


### Structure

Organize your methodology's section so your reader will understand the logical flow of the research or experiment(s); subheadings work well for this purpose. 
Each experiment or research phase should be presented as a unit, even if it was broken up over time. In general, provide enough quantitative detail (how much, how long, when, etc.) about your experimental protocol such that other scientists could reproduce your experiments.
