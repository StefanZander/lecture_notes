# What makes a good Scientific Paper?

## Key Questions to be asked 
 
Before you begin, ask the following questions:

* What **problem** does the work try to solve?
* Does it clearly motivate and clearly formulate the **research question**?
* Does it outline the current knowledge of the **problem domain**, as well as the state of **existing solutions**?
* Does it present clearly any **preliminary ideas**, the proposed **approach** and the **results** achieved so far?
* Does it sketch the **research methodology** that is applied?
* Does it point out the **contributions** of the applicant to the problem solution?
* Does it state in what aspects the suggested solution is **different**, **new**, or **better** as compared to **existing approaches** to the problem?
* Does it state how the attained results are **evaluated** or compared to existing approaches to the problem?
* Does it state how and by whom the **expected results** can be applied?

## Some Hints when the main Contribution is the Development of a Technical Artifact

!!! warning ""
    :warning: The following information is important! Disregarding it  severely :fontawesome-solid-cloud-bolt: harms your paper's quality and assessment.


Here is what you should do if your task is to develop an algorithm / a code module / code component / system etc.

* Do not just develop it and think everything is fine (from a methodological point of view it is not; it is not even heuristiaclly valid)
* Put the **problem** to the front, i.e., make the problem your starting point
* Implement different approaches (that all solve or contribute towards solving the problem – or parts of it)
* Then define KPIs that help you to assess the quality of a solution and that allow you to compare the different solutions w.r.t. the extent to which they solve (or help solving) the problem
* Conduct the analysis and compare the different approaches (methodology: comparative analysis) 
* Present and critically discuss your findings. A critical discussion and a critical assessment of your results is better and more valuable than a palliated and supervicial interpretation. 



## Some Further Tipps

* **Always keep the reader in mind** 
    * Outline and explain your descisions 
    * Provide enough evidence that allows the reader to make an informed assessment about the validity and appropriateness of the choosen and applied methodology as well as about the derived conclusions. 
* **Focus on clarity rather than using jargon**
    * Use passive style only when needed; in Computer Science, the active is often the better and preferred style  
      e.g. not *"it could be seen that..."* – better: *"the data shows that..."*
* **Make sure your claims are not exaggerated**
    * Stick to the facts and generated results
    * Discuss findings in the context of the paper's problem domain
    * Do not hoke up your results or the interpretation of your results. A critical assessment is better and more valuable than a superficial, positively over-exaggerated discussion.
* **A scientific paper follows a well-established structure** 
    * Use the [structural recommendation](structure.md) provided in this course materials in order to help readers in understanding the semantics of parts of our work by conveying the context in which the information is presented.
* **Mention the research problem in the title**
    * Unlike the worlds of newspaper reporting and marketing press releases, the title of a scientific paper should describe the aim of the work (=the problem to be tackled) not the results.
* **Cosider the related and relevant literature thoroughly**
    * Pay attention to a good and critical coverage of related literature.



## Usefull Tools when writing a Thesis and/or Paper

!!! info "A Word of Advice about AI Tools"
    It is totally ok to use AI tools for developing a sound and thorough reserach methodology and/or try to find an interesting research problems. 
    
    :warning: Please do not use such tools for generating paragraphs or parts of your thesis. Such behaviour is regarded as **plagiarism (cheating)** and automatically leads to a "desk rejection" of your work, i.e., a grading with mark 5 plus an entry in your student record.
