# What makes a good Scientific Paper?




## Some Tipps

* Always keep the reader in mind
* Focus on clarity rather than using jargon
* Make sure your claims are not exaggerated
* A scientific paper follows a well-established structure


## Conclusions / Discussions

The aim of this section is to communicate how the results of your work contribute to progress in your field. It can, however, be a difficult balance between being certain in your tone and not conveying arrogance. One guiding principle is to make sure your deductions aren’t over-inflated in their nature, but always backed-up with data and what others have reported. Furthermore, you can discuss any follow-up work that is underway and suggest future research, to provide further credibility to the points you make.

A couple of useful tips on content:

* **Discuss your research’s significance**: You should discuss the key significance of your results. Don’t be tempted to just restate them, that’s what your results section is for.
* **Tackle conflicting research**: You should address any work that disagrees with your findings directly in this section. Rather than lambasting it, convince the reader why your work is an improvement, in a constructive way.
* **Remember to reiterate your objectives**: You should always relate back to the objectives that you laid out in your introduction at this stage, to make the paper congruent for the reader.
