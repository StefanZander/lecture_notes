# What makes a good Scientific Paper?

### Key Questions to be Asked

> What makes a good scientific paper? 
 
Before you begin, ask the following questions:

* Does it clearly motivate and clearly formulate the **research question**?
* Does it outline the current knowledge of the **problem domain**, as well as the state of **existing solutions**?
* Does it present clearly any **preliminary ideas**, the proposed **approach** and the **results** achieved so far?
* Does it sketch the **research methodology** that is applied?
* Does it point out the **contributions** of the applicant to the problem solution?
* Does it state in what aspects the suggested solution is **different**, **new**, or **better** as compared to **existing approaches** to the problem?
* Does it state how the attained results are **evaluated** or compared to existing approaches to the problem?
* Does it state how and by whom the **expected results** can be applied?

### Developing a Technical Artifact

!!! warning
    **Please note**:  
    The following information are important! Diregarding them severely harms your paper's quality and assessment.


Here is what you should do if your task is to develop an algorithm / module / component / system etc.

* Do not just develop it and think everything is fine (from a methodological point of view it is not; it is not even heuristiaclly valid)
* Put the problem to the front, i.e., make the problem your starting point
* Implement different approaches (that all solve or contribute towards solving the problem – or parts of it)
* Then define KPIs that help you to assess the quality of a solution and that allow to compare the different solutions based on the extent to which they solve (or help solving) the problem
* Conduct the analysis and compare the different approaches (methodology: comparative analysis) 
* Present and discuss your findings



### Some Further Tipps

* **Always keep the reader in mind** 
    * Outline and explain your descisions 
    * Provide enough evidence that allows the reader to make an informed assessment about the validity and appropriateness of the choosen and applied methodology as well as about the derived conclusions 
* **Focus on clarity rather than using jargon**
    * Use passive style only when needed; in CS the active is often the better and preferred style  
      e.g. not *"it could be seen that..."* – better: *"the data shows that..."*
* **Make sure your claims are not exaggerated**
    * Stick to the facts and generated results
    * Discuss findings in the context of the paper's problem domain
* **A scientific paper follows a well-established structure** 
    * Use the [structural recommendation](structure.md) provided in this course materials in order to help readers in understanding the semantics of parts of our work by conveying the context in which the information is presented.
* **Mention the research problem in the title**
    * Unlike the worlds of newspaper reporting and marketing press releases, the title of a scientific paper should describe the aim of the work (=the problem to be tackled) not the results.
* **Cosider the related and relevant literature thoroughly**
    * Pay attention to a good and critical coverage of related literature
