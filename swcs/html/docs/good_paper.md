# What makes a good Scientific Paper?




## Some Tipps

* Always keep the reader in mind, 
    * outline and explain your descisions 
    * provide enough evidence that allows the reader to make an informed assessment about the validity and appropriateness of the choosen and applied methodology as well as about the derived conclusions 
* Focus on clarity rather than using jargon
    * Use passive style only when needed; in CS the active is often the better and preferred style  
      e.g. not *"it could be seen that..."* – better: *"the data shows that..."*
* Make sure your claims are not exaggerated
    * Stick to the facts and generated results
    * Discuss findings in the context of the paper's problem domain
* A scientific paper follows a well-established structure – use this in order to help readers in understanding the semantics of parts of our work by conveying the context in which the information is presented.
* Unlike the worlds of newspaper reporting and marketing press releases, the title of a scientific paper should describe the aim of the work (=the problem to be tackled) not the results.
* Pay attention to a good and critical coverage of related literature



### Key Questions to be asked

Adapted from <file:///Users/stefan/Downloads/papers-howtowrite.pdf>

What makes a good scientific paper; before you begin, ask the following questions:

* Does it clearly motivate and clearly formulate the **research question**?
* Does it outline the current knowledge of the **problem domain**, as well as the state of **existing solutions**?
* Does it present clearly any **preliminary ideas**, the proposed **approach** and the **results** achieved so far?
* Does it sketch the **research methodology** that is applied?
* Does it point out the **contributions** of the applicant to the problem solution?
* Does it state in what aspects the suggested solution is **different**, **new**, or **better** as compared to **existing approaches** to the problem?
* Does it state how the attained results are **evaluated** or compared to existing approaches to the problem?
* Does it state how and by whom the **expected results** can be applied?

## Conclusions / Discussions

The aim of this section is to communicate how the results of your work contribute to progress in your field. It can, however, be a difficult balance between being certain in your tone and not conveying arrogance. One guiding principle is to make sure your deductions aren’t over-inflated in their nature, but always backed-up with data and what others have reported. Furthermore, you can discuss any follow-up work that is underway and suggest future research, to provide further credibility to the points you make.

A couple of useful tips on content:

* **Discuss your research’s significance**: You should discuss the key significance of your results. Don’t be tempted to just restate them, that’s what your results section is for.
* **Tackle conflicting research**: You should address any work that disagrees with your findings directly in this section. Rather than lambasting it, convince the reader why your work is an improvement, in a constructive way.
* **Remember to reiterate your objectives**: You should always relate back to the objectives that you laid out in your introduction at this stage, to make the paper congruent for the reader.
