# The Structure of Scientific Papers

!!! abstract
    **Objectives**

    - [x] You know how scientific works are structured in general
    - [x] You are able to develop an appropriate structure according to the specific type of your scientific work


This page contains information about the **general structure** of scientific papers. It helps you to structure your paper (and with it your research) accordingly and provides links to pages where you find **detailed information** about each structural element. 

!!! note
    Please be aware that different scientific communities might employ slightly different structures – although the main structural elements and their content remain identical.


## Preamble

Scientific papers follow a **predefined structure** the objective of which is to present **acquired results** and the **deployed methodology** upon which the results were generated in appropriate ways. The objective of deploying such a predefined structure is to support the **exploitation** and **comprehension** of research results and demonstrate the adherence of good scientific work practices such as

- internal and external validity
- construct validity
- reliability of results
- etc.

In the following, we present a structural recommendation for the **two main types** of scientific papers in computer science:

1. Original **Research Papers**, and
2. **Surveys**

Each structural element for both types of works is described in detail on a **separate details page** that can be retrieved by following the link pointing to it.

The **details pages** are all structured identically:  

1. They introduce a **structural element** by describing its

    * **Function** –
        Explaining the main purpose of a section

    * **Style** –
        Expounding the type of writing stlye usually applied for writing the section

    * **Structure** –
        Describes elements or tipps on how to structure a section accordingly

2. and provide some **tipps** or **remarks** for some elements.

<!-- The following fields contain a list of the main elements separated by the different types of scientific papers (for this course, we distinguish between the two main types of papers in CS – original research paper and surveys).  -->
