# The Structure of Scientific Papers

!!! abstract
    **Objectives**

    - [x] You know how scientific works are structured in general
    - [x] You can apply an appropriate structure to your type of scientific work


This page contains information about the **general structure** of scientific papers. It helps you to structure your paper and reearch work accordingly and provides links to pages where you find **detailed information** about each structural topic. 

!!! note
    Please be aware that different scientific communities might employ slightly different structures although the main structural elements and contents remain identical.


## Preamble

Scientific papers follow a **predefined structure** the objective of which is to present **acquired results** and the **deployed methodology** upon which the results were acquired in appropriate ways. The objective of deploying such a predefined structure is to support the **exploitation** and **dissemination** of research results. 

In the following, we presented a structural recommendation for the two main types of scientific papers in computer science:

1. Original **Research Papers**, and
2. **Surveys**

Each structural element for both types of work is described in detail on a **separate details page** that can be looked up by following the link pointing to it.

The **details pages** are all structured identically:  

1. They introduce a **structural topic** by describing its

    * **Function** –
        Explaining the main purpose of a section

    * **Style** –
        Expounding the type of writing stlye usually applied for writing the section

    * **Structure** –
        Describes elements or tipps on how to structure a section accordingly

2. and provide some **tipps** or **remarks** for some elements.

<!-- The following fields contain a list of the main elements separated by the different types of scientific papers (for this course, we distinguish between the two main types of papers in CS – original research paper and surveys).  -->

## Structure of a Research Paper

!!! Example
    **Main Elements of a Research Paper**

    - [Title](elements/title.md)
    - [Abstract](elements/abstract.md)
    - [Introduction](elements/introduction.md)
        <!-- - Motivation -->
        <!-- - Problem Statement and Research Questions -->
        <!-- - Contributions -->
    - [Background (*optional*)](elements/background.md)
    - [Related Work](elements/related_work.md) 
    - [Approach (*aka Methodology*)](elements/methodology.md)
    - [Realisation (*in CS often named 'Implementation'*)](elements/implementation.md)
    - [Evaluation & Discussion](elements/evaluation.md)
    - [Discussion (_often included in the evaluation_)](elements/evaluation.md) 
    - [Conclusion (*incl. Future Work*)](elements/conclusion.md)
    - [Acknowledgements (*optional*)](elements/acknowledgements.md)
    - [References](elements/references.md)



## Structure of a Survey

!!! Example
    **Main Elements of a Survey**

    - [Title](elements/title.md)
    - [Abstract](elements/abstract.md)
    - [Introduction _(incl. SOTA)_](elements/introduction.md) 
        <!-- - Motivation -->
        <!-- - Problem Statement and Research Questions -->
        <!-- - Overview of Methodology -->
    - [Scope](elements/scope.md)
    - [Description of Analysis Criteria and Methodology (*aka Methodology*)](elements/methodology.md)
    - Analysis
    - Discussion
    - [Related Work](elements/related_work.md)
    - [Conclusion (*incl. Future Work*)](elements/conclusion.md)
    - [Acknowledgements (*optional*)](elements/acknowledgements.md)
    - [References](elements/references.md)
