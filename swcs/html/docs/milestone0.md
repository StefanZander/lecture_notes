    !!! warning
        **Take Responsibility!**  
        One of the main principles of this course is to learn to take responsibility for your work and the outcome. Be aware, that this is not a regular university course in which you get all necessary information hand-feeded. Instead you are required to take actions, organize yourself, set goals, estimate and meet expectations, seek for support when you encounter problems or difficulties etc.  
        
        Remember, your course lecturer is always available and happy to help and support you – BUT the **initiative must come from your side**; --> this is part of your responsibility.

    - If no questions arise, we assume that everything is clear to you – with all the consequences.
