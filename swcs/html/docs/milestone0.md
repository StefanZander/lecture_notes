    !!! warning "Take Responsibility!"
        One of the main principles of this course is to learn to __take responsibility for your work and your outcome__. Be aware, that this is _not_ a standard university course in which you get all necessary information hand-feeded. Instead, you are required to take actions, organize yourself, set goals, estimate and meet expectations, seek for support when you encounter problems or difficulties etc.  
        
        ==_Remember, your course lecturer is always available to help and support you – BUT the **initiative must come from your side**
         --> it is your responsibility._==

    - If no questions arise, we assume that everything is clear to you – with all the consequences.
