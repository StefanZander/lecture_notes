# Factsheet and Abstract (Milestone #2)

<!-- !!! question
    This milstone will be graded with factor: **1** -->


!!! abstract
    **Objectives**

    - [x] You are familiar with the main elements a good abstract must contain
    - [x] You can write an abstract for your research paper
    - [x] You know the role and function of an fact sheet 

    **Grading Factor: 1**





## Tasks


1. Write a 1-2 pages long **Factsheet** that employs the subsequently given structure about your research.
    The Factsheet should help you in developing appropriate **research questions** and driving your research endeavour (it serves as an "*Exposé light*")

2. Write an **Abstract** based on the information outlined in the Factsheet.
    - The Abstract must be meaningful and only as long as necessary but as precise as possible  
      _(approx. 100 – 200 words; not longer than 5-7 sentences)_
    - Use the [Springer LNCS template](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/new-latex-templates-available/15634678)
    
    !!! note
        **Writing the Abstract**: Write the Abstract from a perspective of what you *intend* to achieve. Change this perspective of what you *have* achieved for the final paper.

3. Submit both Factsheet and Abstract as a **single PDF file** via **EasyChair** (_registration required_)  
    <!-- - Use the following link for the module "**Scientific Writing for Computer Science**":
        - Link: <https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=swcssose2020> -->
    - Use this link for the module "**Wissenschaftliches Arbeiten in der Informatik 2**":

        <!-- - <https://resource-cms.springernature.com/springer-cms/rest/v1/content/19238648/data/v4> -->
    - **Register** both authors at the EasyChair system and enter all relevant information
  
        !!! note
            **Registration Policy**: Both(!) authors need to register at the EasyChair system. Please use your official student email addresses for the registration as I will use these later to register you as Programme Committee (PC) Member for the reviews. If author and programme committee email addresses do *not* match, problems will occur during the paper assignment.

    - **Upload** the document to the easychair system
        
        !!! warning
            **Uploading or Updating your Paper in EasyChair**: Once you uploaded the paper, EasyChair assigns you a single slot. Use this slot during the entire semester, i.e., if you want to upload an updated version of the Factsheet and Abstract, just update (=overwrite) the already entered information.

## Explanatory Information

### The Factsheet

The Factsheet describes **corner stones** of your research. It serves as **basis** for writing a meaningful and concise **abstract** and drives your research. The factsheet can (and should!) also be used as foundation for writing a **thesis exposé** for your intended thesis supervisor.

Use the following structure and document each aspect with very few sentences:

- <https://projects.fbi.h-da.de/~s.zander/wai/html/expose/>

<!-- 1. **Title and (optionally) Subheading**
2. **Problem Statement** ie., what is the problem and why is it a problem (the motivation of your work)
3. **Research Questions** ie., what questions will your research provide answers for
    The research questions should be short, precise and concise; they should be tractable, ie., they should be directly answerable 
4. Approach  
    ie., specify what you are planing to do
5. Methodology ie., describe how you conduct your research (ie., the analysis)
6. Results ie., what results or insights are you expecting
7. Sources -->

<!-- Preliminary title

The preliminary title of your research paper. Of course the title can change during the course of your work.

Please note:
The title should reflect the problem statement of your work and it should only be as long as necessary. In order to keep the main title short, use a sub title. Never use very long or complex constructs for your title –  those things only dilute your work's main objective.

The problem statement

The problem statement (often referred to as the motivation) is one of the crucial elements of your exposé. In this section you explain the specific problem your work contemplates on. -->



### Abstract

!!! warning
    **The Importance of the Abstract**:  
    The **abstract** is probably the **most important** and **most difficult** part to write of your paper.  
    Hence, it definitly pays off to put a lot of effort and thoughts in creating a sound and meaningful abstract.

The abstract helps the reader to determine whether it is **worth their time** to read your paper and whether they find the information they are looking for in it.
The abstract therefore should outline the **main insights** (=results) of your work together with a description of the problem space and the methodology applied in creating the insights.

### Leading Questions

In order to provide that information, the abstract should answer the following **4 leading questions**:

- What is the problem – WHAT
- Why is this a problem – WHY
- What are the specific contributions and how were they achieved – CONTRIBUTIONS & METHODOLOGY
- What is the impact of the work – IMPACT

### Structural Elements

These questions also serve as basis for **structuring** the abstract: 

- The research problem 
- The impact of the research problem
- The results (=contributions) created togehter with the applied methodology 
- The consequences or insights following from the results
- (*optionally*) Outline scope and setting at the beginning of the abstract in 1 sentence

*Address each of these aspects with only 1 or 2 sentences.*

As a consequence, the abstract should *not* be longer than **5 - 7 sentences** for a regular research paper (longer works can have a more comprehensive abstract, but it should never exceed the limit of one page length).

!!! note
    **A well-written Abstract is short and precise!**  
    The abstract must be **precise** and **meaningful**. It should only be as long as necessary but as precise as possible!
