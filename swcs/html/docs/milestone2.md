    This milstone will be graded with factor: **1**

    **Objectives**

    - [x] ...


## Tasks


1. Write a 1-2 pages long **Factsheet** that employs the subsequently given structure about your research.
    The Factsheet should help you in developing appropriate **research questions** and driving your research endeavour (it serves as an "*Exposé light*")

2. Write an **Abstract** based on the information outlined in the Factsheet.
    - The Abstract must be meaningful and only as long as necessary but as precise as possible  
      _(approx. 100 – 200 words; not longer than 5-7 sentences)_
    - Use the [Springer LNCS template](add link)
    
    !!! note
        **Note**: Write the Abstract from a perspective of what you *intend* to achieve. Change this perspective of what you *have* achieved for the final paper.

3. Submit both Factsheet and Abstract as a **single PDF file** via **EasyChair** (_registration required_)  
    - Link: <https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=swcssose2019>
    - **Register** both authors at the EasyChair system and enter all relevant information
  
        !!! note
            **Note**: Both(!) authors need to register at the EasyChair system. Please use your official student email addresses for the registration as I will use these later to register you as Programme Committee (PC) Member for the reviews. If author and programme committee email addresses *do not match*, problems will occur during the paper assignment.

    - **Upload** the document to the easychair system
        
        !!! warning
            **Note**: Once you uploaded the paper, EasyChair assigns you a single slot. Use this slot during the entire semester, i.e., if you want to upload an updated version of the Factsheet and Abstract, just update (=overwrite) the already entered information.  
            --> __DO NOT CREATE A NEW SUBMISSION!__


## Background Information

### Factsheet

The Factsheet describes **corner stones** of your research. It serves as **basis** for writing a meaningful and concise abstract and drives your research.

#### Structure

Use the following structure and document each aspect with very few sentences:

1. **Title and (optionally) Subheading**
2. **Problem Statement** ie., what is the problem and why is it a problem (--> the motivation of your work)
3. **Research Questions** ie., what questions will your research provide answers for
    The research questions should be short, precise and concise; they should be tractable, ie., they should be directly answerable 

4. Approach  
    ie., specify what you are planing to do
5. Methodology ie., describe how you conduct your research (ie., the analysis)
6. Results ie., what results or insights are you expecting
7. Sources




### Abstract

!!! warning
    **Please note**:  
    The abstract is probably the most important and most difficult to write part of your paper.  
    So it definitly pays off to put a lot of effort in creating a sound and meaningful abstract.

The abstract helps the reader to determine whether it is worth their time to read your paper and whether they find the information they are looking for.
The abstract therefore should outline the main insights (=results) of your work together with a description of the problem space and the methodology applied in creating the insights.


In order to provide that information, the abstract should answer the following 4 questions:

- What is the problem – WHAT
- Why is this a problem – WHY
- What are the specific contributions – CONTRIBUTIONS
- What is the impact of the work – IMPACT

These questions also serve as basis for **structuring** the abstract: 

- The research problem 
- The impact of the research problem
- The results (=contributions) created togehter with the applied methodology 
- The consequences or insights following from the results
- (*optionally*) Outline scope and setting at the beginning of the abstract in 1 sentence

*Address each of these aspects with only 1 or 2 sentences.*

As a consequence, the abstract should *not* be longer than **5 - 7 sentences** for a regular research paper (longer works can have a more comprehensive abstract, but it should never exceed the limit of one page length).

!!! note
    **Please note**: The abstract must be precise and meaningful; it should only be as long as necessary but as precise as possible!
