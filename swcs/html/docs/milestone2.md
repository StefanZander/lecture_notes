    **Objectives**

    - [x] ...


## Factsheet

The Factsheet describes **corner stones** of your research. It serves as **basis** for writing a meaningful and concise abstract and drives your research.


### Tasks

1. Write a 1-2 pages long **Factsheet** that employs the subsequently given structure about your research.
    The Factsheet should help you in developing appropriate **research questions** and driving your research endeavour (it serves as an "*Exposé light*")

### Structure

Use the following structure and document each aspect with very few sentences:

1. **Title and (optionally) Subheading**
2. **Problem Statement** ie., what is the problem and why is it a problem (--> the motivation of your work)
3. **Research Questions** ie., what questions will your research provide answers for
    The research questions should be short, precise and concise; they should be tractable, ie., they should be directly answerable 

4. Approach  
    ie., specify what you are planing to do
5. Methodology ie., describe how you conduct your research (ie., the analysis)
6. Results ie., what results or insights are you expecting
7. Sources




## Abstract

### Task

1. Write an **Abstract** based on the information outlined in the Factsheet.
    - The Abstract must be meaningful and as long as necessary but as precise as possible  
      _(approx. 100 – 200 words; not longer than 5-7 sentences)_
    - Use the [Springer LNCS template](add link)
    
    !!! note
        **Note**: Write the Abstract from a perspective of what you *intend* to achieve. Change this perspective of what you *have* achieved for the final paper.

2. Submit both Factsheet and Abstract as a **single PDF file** via **EasyChair** (_registration required_)  
    - Link: <https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=swcssose2019>
    - Register both authors at the easychair system and enter all relevant information
  
        !!! note
            **Note**: Both(!) authors need to register at the easychair system. Please use your official student email addresses for the registration as I will use these later to register you for the reviews. If author and programme committee email adresses do not match, problems will occur during the review assignment.

    - Upload the document to the easychair system
        
        !!! note
            **Note**: Once you uploaded the paper, easychair assigns you a single slot. Use this slot during the entire semester, i.e., if you want to upload an updated version of the Factsheet and Abstract, just update (=overwrite) the already entered information.
