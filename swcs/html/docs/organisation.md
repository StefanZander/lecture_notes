    `[SWCS] {lastname_person1}, {lastname_person2}: {matter}` (without `{}`)

    !!! note
        Please note that the curly braces (`{}`) are indicators for tokens that should be replaced with the real names and topic (without `{}` of course).

        Although this was explained in the lecture, a number of students' emails contains the previous template in the stated form...
