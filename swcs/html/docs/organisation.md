# Organisation

On this page, you find information about

- ...how to properly **communicate** with your instructor
- ...the **in-class lectures** 
- ...how you can request **tutorials** or **supervision**
- ...how to **submit** your results
- ...the **grading**.

## Communication

- Usually via email, skype or as indiviual appointments (contact me via email for arranging an individual appointment)
- Please use the following subject when asking questions via email:  
    `[SWCS] {lastname_person1}, {lastname_person2}: {matter}` (without `{}`)

    !!! note
        Please note that the curly braces (`{}`) are indicators for tokens that should be replaced with the real names and matter (without `{}` of course).

        Although this is discussed in the lecture, a significant number of students' emails usually contain the previous template in the stated form...


## In-Class Lectures

- Depends on the student's familirarity with the topic; 
- In general only very few – but attendance is compulsory
    - Kick-off meeting
    - Final presentations
- More lectures in the form of 
    - tutorials about selected topics, 
    - Q&A sessions 
    - etc. 
  
    can be requested by the students – _and I am happy to provide them!_

    --> The following section provides more information about them.

    <!-- _"I am happy to offer more lectures e.g. in form of tutorials etc. about specific topics but those have to be requested by the students"_ -->
