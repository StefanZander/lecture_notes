    - [x] ...the **in-class lectures** 
    - [x] ...how you can request **tutorials** or **supervision**
    - [x] ...how to **submit** your results

## Communication

- Usually via **email**, **BBB** or as **indiviual appointments** via <https://rooms.h-da.de/r?room=Zander%2C+Stefan+%28fbi%29> 
    _-->_ contact me via email for arranging an individual appointment
- Please use the following subject `WAI` __OR__ `SWCS` when asking questions via email:  
    `[SWCS|WAI] {matter}` (without `{}` of course)

    !!! info "Please consider the correct email subject"
        Please note that the curly braces (`{}`) are indicators for tokens that should be replaced with the real names and matter (without `{}` of course).

        Please also enter the **correct module** (WAI/SWCS) your request is referring to.

        N.B. _Although these things are introduced here as well as in the lecture, a significant number of students' emails usually neglects these instructions, which makes it harder to treat the request appropriately and in-time._
