# Course Overview and Objectives

This site outlines the **main objectives** of this course together with a condensed list of **crucial elements** that scientific works exhibit. More details and background information about these elements can be found in the **literature recommendations**.


## Objectives

- Learn how to write a scientific paper by following the **principles of good scientific practices**
- Develop a **problem statement** and derive **research questions** for a specific topic
- Develop a **research methodology** to tackle an identified problem in a systematic, well-structured, and scientifically sound way
- Learn how to **document** and **present** your **research results** properly 
- Learn how to write a precise and concise **abstract**
- Learn how to write a **review** for one of your colleagues‘ papers
- Search for relevant literature in **scientific literature databases**
- Become acquianted with the **EasyChair** conference system ([--> Link](https://easychair.org/))


!!! warning
    **Note**: Maybe the most important objective of this course is to experience and learn how to **independently work on a subject** in an efficient, coordinated, and systematic way so that defined **quality standards** *(=those that make a good scientific paper; see [Elements of Scientific Work](objectives.md#elements_of_scientific_work))* are reached. 


## Elements of Scientific Work

The section briefly mentions some of the elementary components and concepts of propoer scientific work pratice.

- Neutrality and objectivity in thinking and writing
- Incorporate information from primary literature hosted in scientific libraries
- Construct Validity – Appropriateness of the chosen methodology for tackling an identified problem (--> *Reproducability*)
- External Validity – Replicability of the applied methodology and obtained results (--> *Generalisation*)
- Internal Validity – Logical consistency of the causality chain (--> *"Inducability"*)
- Following the principles of good scientific work practices
    - Correct indication of external ideas and content
    - Citing external work correctly 
    - Avoid plagiarism
- Deliniation of own work to related works and 
- Elaboration of the State-of-the-Art (SOTA)
- *and many more...*

!!! note
    **Note**: Consult the literature recommendations for more details and background information.
