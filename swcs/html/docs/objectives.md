# Course Overview and Objectives

This site outlines the **main objectives** of this course together with a condensed list of **crucial elements** that scientific works exhibit. More details and background information about these elements can be found in the **literature recommendations**.


## Objectives

- Learn how to write a scientific paper by following the **principles of good scientific practices**
- Develop a **problem statement** and derive **research questions** for a specific topic
- Develop a **research methodology** to tackle an identified problem in a systematic, well-structured, and scientifically sound way
- Learn how to **document** and **present** your **research results** properly 
- Learn how to write a precise and concise **abstract**
- Learn how to write a **review** for one of your colleagues‘ papers
- Search for relevant literature in **scientific literature databases**
- Become acquianted with the **EasyChair** conference system ([--> Link](https://easychair.org/))


!!! warning
    **Note**: Maybe the most important objective of this course is to experience and learn how to **independently work on a subject** in an efficient, coordinated, and systematic way so that defined **quality standards** *(=those that make a good scientific paper; see [Elements of Scientific Work](objectives.md#elements_of_scientific_work))* are reached. 


## Elements of Scientific Work

The section briefly mentions some of the elementary components and concepts of proper scientific work practice.

- **Neutrality and objectivity in thinking and writing**  
    Make no personal judgements and don't emphasize things you find interesting or fun, i.e., do not over-emphasize things based on personal judgement. Be as neutral as possible in both thinking and writing. Treat all works your considered for your analysis equal, i.e., do not describe one work in a rather long paragraph and another work with onyl one or two sentences. Use identical criteria when you analyze relevant works and ideas upon which your research is based on.  

- **Use literature from scientific databases as your primary source of information**  
    Built your research upon information from the primary literature hosted in established scientific libraries.
    Use peer-reviewed papers from conferences or journals as your main literature source. 

- **Construct Validity**  
    Ensure the appropriateness of the chosen methodology for tackling an identified problem so that others, when applying your methodology are likely to gather the same or comparable results (--> *Reproducability*)

- **External Validity**  
    Consider the replicability and transferability of the applied methodology and obtained results (--> *Generalisation*)

- **Internal Validity**  
    Make sure that the logical consistency of the causality chain is maintained, i.e., that you used the appropriate set of methods for takling a problem and that the conclusions you draw from your observations are both verifyable and valid  (--> *"Inducability"*)

- **Follow the principles of good scientific work practices**  
    This usually involves many aspects even bejond the creation of scientific artefacts (*--> consult the links in the literature recommendations for more in-depth information about good scientific work practices*). From previous experiences with students' submissions, the following few principles revealed to be of immediate importance as they directly influence a paper's assessment:
    
    - **Correct indication of external ideas and content**  
        It should be clear in your texts what is your idea and what resulted from external works
    
    - **Citing external work correctly**  
        Be advised: Anything you take from external works need to be indicated, i.e., cited.
        Only take a max. of 3 words directly from external works, not more. 

        !!! warning
            **Please note**: Do not copy whole paragraphs from external works and only provide one citation at the paragraphs end. This counts as plagiarism and will be treated as such.

        The LaTeX template provided for this course is already pre-configured and implements a common citation style; so there is no need to modify that.
    
    - **Avoid plagiarism**  
        This is one of the most crucial elements of good scientific work. Disregarding this principle in general leads to desk rejection of your work and impairs your name. h_da treats plagiarism as an attempt of deception and creates a note in your student record.

- **Deliniate your own work from related works**  
    This aspect is often neglected in students' papers and even final theses, which is really unfortunate. Science is not about re-inventing the wheel or copying things others did earlier for the sake of matter (e.g. because students think it might lead to a high assessment of their works because it sounds sophisticated and complex). It is about valuing the work of others and showing how your own work builts (or deliniates) from them. This tremendously helps the reading in grasping the novel aspects of your ideas and work.
    
- **Elaboration of the State-of-the-Art (SOTA)**  
    As we have learned, science is standing on the shoulders of giants. Hence, your work is likely to be influenced by existing works; *name and discuss these!* The discussion of the SOTA is a direct implementation of the science metaphor. This helps the reader to position your work in a domain and wrt. the problem it aims to solve of provides contributions for.

- *and many more...*
