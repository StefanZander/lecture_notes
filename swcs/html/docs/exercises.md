    **How would you assess the following abstract:**

    New malicious software released daily makes employing anti-virus applications imperative for protecting the ever-increasing amount of sensitive digital data of individuals and organizations alike. However, without extensive research, choosing the right tool for a usage environ- ment can be difficult. This survey will attempt to evaluate, compare and recommend commercial, free-to-use and open-source software solutions based on various qualitative criteria such as security, features and usabil- ity. We will derive these criteria by examining previous studies on the methods of malware detection and their effectiveness, in addition to our own evaluation of the provided functionality.

    **Introduction**

    1.1 Motivation

    In today’s world, an ever-increasing amount of data is handled and stored digi- tally. Companies and other organizations, institutions such as hospitals or schools, as well as governments and their agencies all produce and process huge amounts of often personal and/or sensitive data. Of course the growing digitalization of our society is not limited to these organizations. Most people in the world today use a computer in some form or another, be it a laptop or a smartphone. In addition to that, cloud services are vastly popular for accessing data from any- where at any time. Of course all of this opens up a world of potential data theft, extortion and blackmailing, sabotage and espionage. To protect themselves, or- ganizations as well as private individuals, have to employ some sort of protection against these threats, which comes most often in the form of malware. This re- sults in a huge demand for antivirus applications, and this demand has resulted in a similarly large supply of those applications, providing the right tool for almost every environment.

    This paper analyses various aspects of game-based learning to inform developers and teachers alike about the benefits of putting more effort into developing these kinds of tools for future generations of students and to integrate these tools into the classroom. Games play a big part in the lives of most children nowadays meaning there is now more potential than ever to bring game-like elements into learning spaces. Games can introduce difficult to learn concepts in environments where students are already familiar with making them easier to digest and al- lowing further learning to be done on these concepts in the future.

    It is important to first figure out if these tools are beneficial in a learning space or if they would do more harm than good. This paper uncovers what type of games are best suited to different problem sets and different areas of interest within the classroom. Bringing game-like software into the classroom would not come without possible problems. The main concern is that students may be too fixated on game mechanics and the desire to succeed in the game rather than the actual learning being done. While most children today play games and are familiar with them, we must consider those who have never played a game in their life. This is more concerning in the field of adult education, where it is very likely that students may have never played a game before. The philosophy of introducing games into the classroom stems from the idea of gamification. This concept is described as introducing game elements in non-gaming contexts, such as steady progression, levels and a learning curve that introduces concepts over time. The use of games in education offers students a new way of learning. It is well known that there are many types of learning styles out there such as visual, aural and physical[9]. With the addition of gaming into education, students can add another dimension to what learning style suits them best.

    ”What do we mean by the gamification of education? After all, schools already have several game-like elements. Students get points for completing assignments correctly. These points translate to badges, more commonly known as grades. Students are rewarded for desired behaviors and punished for undesirable be- haviors using this common currency as a reward system. If they perform well, students ”level up” at the end of every academic year.” (Lee \& Hammer,2011, P. 2)

## Scope

!!! example
    **Please read and discuss improvements of the following scope section**:

    This paper was conducted to understand what affects games can have on stu- dent’s in their education. The aspects looked into where tools already used in education as well as its impact on the users. Drawing information from previous research papers already in this field as well as information from teachers that have experience with these tools.
