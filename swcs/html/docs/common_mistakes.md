# What makes a good Scientific Paper?




## Common Mistakes

* Paper reads like a report
* Paper just states background technology or what others have already stated
* Paper fails to address a specific research problem (i.e., a problem that requires extensive research to find an answer / solution for) (--> if the extend of research is considerbly low, this is a clear indicator that the topic and problem requires more thoughts)
* Research Questions are formulated too broadly / too general
    e.g. How can context be modelled with technology xyz?
	Those questions can not be answered directly and just provide heuristic answers
	They do not provide any clues about the extend of quality of a proposed solution (e.g. you can not say whether an approach is "better" than another or in which aspects an approach exceeds another one)
* Paper fails to comply with the de-facto standard structure of scientific papers
* No consideration of the state-of-the-art (SOTA)
* Paper's contributions are not put in relevance/relation to the SOTA
* Fail to discuss the extent (quality/effectiveness) of the contributions wrt. the research questions
* Missing evaluation or justification of the results wrt. the extent to which they help in answering the RQs
* Missing discussion of evaluation results
* Neglection of results published in form of primary literature ()
* Contributions are not clearly visible (--> readers can only guess of what the authors have achieved and how the contributions extend the SOTA)
* ...


## Common Mistakes of Scientific Presentations

* Do not start with the talk's agenda (--> each scientific talk follows a standardized agenda; there is no need to make that explicit)
* start by motivating the problem the work provides contributions for
*
