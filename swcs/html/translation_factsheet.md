## Preliminary Title

The preliminary title of your research paper. Of course the title can change during the course of your work.

!!! note
    **Please note**:
    The title should reflect the problem statement of your work and it should only be as long as necessary. In order to keep the main title short, you could use a sub title. Never use very long or complex constructs for your title –  those constructs only dilute your work's main objective.

The title should contain the motiviation (problem statement) of your work.

## The problem statement

The problem statement (often referred to as the motivation) resembles the motivational element of your exposé. In this section, you explain the specific problem your work contemplates on.

The description of the problem statement should be concise and precise.
The structure shluld follow the [inverted pyramid](), i.e., it should address the main issue first and then work towards subsequently followig or adhering issues and their embedment in a working or professional context.

A commonly seen problem is that the problem statement is formulated as an introduction to the topic. This is bad style in most cases and should be avoided (although there might be rare cases in which is seems appropriate). The main focus should lie on the specific problem the work aims to tackle, so be very careful and [sparsam] with introductory sentences.

Another commonly seen issue is that the problem statement is not formulated precisely enough but rather very general.
This is problematic for a number of reasons:
Your work is expected to make a concrete contribution towards the solution of a given problem or topic. 
The more precisely the problem statement is formulated, the more clearer the solution and following steps will be.
In addition, a precisely formulated problem statement also allows to better evaluate whether your work's contributions really help in solving a problem, i.e., to assess whether you work's assets sufficiently contribute towards a solution to the problem.
