Preliminary title

The preliminary title of your research paper. Of course the title can change during the course of your work.

Please note:
The title should reflect the problem statement of your work and it should only be as long as necessary. In order to keep the main title short, use a sub title. Never use very long or complex constructs for your title –  those things only dilute your work's main objective.

The problem statement

The problem statement (often referred to as the motivation) is one of the crucial elements of your exposé. In this section you explain the specific problem your work contemplates on.
